        <ul>
          <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets: gives the content style.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Marigin and padding are often confused. Padding is trnsparent but makes the element bigger, while the margin is the transparent buffer around the element.</li>
