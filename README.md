# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was made to have a centralized location for notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The process of building the webpage was a hands-on tool to help learn by doing. Using this project as a hands-on learning tool has taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The problem that was solved during this process was making sure my notes were in one centralized location. I have learned that eventhough I am further along than when I started, I have a long way to go. With persistence and repetition I know that I can become a great developer.  

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage

Each section of the webpage is notes on different topics. If the DevTools console is open(right click, "Inspect") we can see that JavaScript is running. 
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
